Implementing a Set of template objects
A Set is a collection of data that cannot contain duplicates

The Set of elements is implemented by defining a struct element, which it will represent
the elements that will make up the Set, and of a Set template class, which will represent the real and
own Set.
The class has const_iterators that iterate over the elements that make up the Set.
